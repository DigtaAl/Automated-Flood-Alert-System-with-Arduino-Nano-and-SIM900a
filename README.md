## Background

Floods pose a significant threat to communities worldwide, causing immense damage to property, infrastructure, and, most importantly, endangering lives. In an effort to address the challenges posed by floods, we have developed the FloodGuard, an Arduino Nano-based automated flood detection system.

Flooding is a recurring natural disaster with far-reaching consequences, impacting both urban and rural areas. Traditional flood monitoring systems often lack the efficiency and real-time capabilities needed to provide timely warnings to residents and authorities. Our FloodGuard system aims to fill this gap by offering an affordable and reliable solution for early flood detection.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the FloodGuard system include:

1. **Early Warning:** Provide real-time monitoring and early detection of flood conditions to enable timely evacuation and preventive measures.

2. **Accessibility:** Create a cost-effective solution that can be easily deployed in various locations, including remote or underserved areas.

3. **Integration:** Utilize Arduino Nano technology, SIM900a for communication, and ultrasonic sensors to create a seamless and integrated flood detection system.

## Features

- **Automated Detection:** FloodGuard uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor water levels continuously, triggering alerts when a potential flood is detected.

- **Instant Notifications:** The system is equipped with SIM900a for instant communication, sending notifications to designated authorities and residents via SMS in real-time.

- **Low-Cost and Scalable:** Designed with affordability in mind, FloodGuard can be scaled for widespread deployment to enhance flood monitoring networks.

## Future Enhancements

We envision continuous improvements for FloodGuard, including:

- Integration with weather forecasting data for more accurate flood predictions.
- Enhanced communication capabilities, such as integrating with IoT platforms.
- Community engagement features, allowing residents to receive alerts directly on their smartphones.
